      For the treatment of cured defaulted exposures, a probation period of 90 days with no default triggers 
      must apply before the exposure is moved back to a non-defaulted status. According to Article 178(1)(b CRR) 
      default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when the obligor is more 
      than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation. However, if the material arrears fall below the 
      thresholds, the arrears counter will reset to 0. Should the probation period of 90 days with no default 
      triggers apply before the exposure is moved back to a non-defaulted status?

      1. A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or 
      both of the following have taken place:
        (a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, 
        the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions 
        such as realising security;
        (b) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the 
        parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days 
        for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as 
        exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127.

        In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) 
        and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to 
        the total obligations of a borrower.

      2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
        (a) for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised 
        a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying 
        amount is material;
        (b) for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution 
        and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;
        (c) days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;
        (d) materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the 
        competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers 
        to be reasonable;
        (e) institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular 
        in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, 
        renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and 
        shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.

        3. For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to 
        pay shall include the following:
        (a) the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;
        (b) the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline 
        in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;
        (c) the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;
        (d) the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely 
        to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of 
        principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under 
        a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;
        (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's 
        credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;
        (f) the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid 
        or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.

        4. Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid 
        down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.

        5. If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default 
        continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. 
        Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.

        6. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which a 
        competent authority shall set the threshold referred to in paragraph 2(d).

        7. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance 
        with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

        71. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for
        situations referred to in paragraph 72, institutions should apply all of the following:
        (a) consider that no trigger of default continues to apply to a previously defaulted
        exposure, where at least 3 months have passed since the moment that the conditions
        referred to in Articles 178(1)(b) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cease to
        be met;
        (b) take into account the behaviour of the obligor during the period referred to in point (a);
        (c) take into account the financial situation of the obligor during the period referred to in
        point (a);
        (d) after the period referred to in point (a), perform an assessment, and, where the
        institution still finds that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations in full without
        recourse to realising security, the exposures should continue to be classified as
        defaulted until the institution is satisfied that the improvement of the credit quality is
        factual and permanent;
        (e) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) should be met also with regard to new
        exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this
        obligor were sold or written off.
        Institutions may apply the period referred to in point (a) to all exposures or apply different
        periods for different types of exposures.
        
        72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where
        distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted
        exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the
        identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to
        apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest
        between one of the following events:
        (a) the moment of extending the restructuring measures;
        (b) the moment when the exposure has been classified as defaulted;
        (c) the end of the grace period included in the restructuring arrangements. 

  expected: |
      Minimum conditions for reclassification of a defaulted exposure or obligor to a non-defaulted status, 
      for the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR), are specified 
      in the Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 
      No 575/2013 (EBA/GL/2016/07).

      Except for situations referred to in paragraph 72 of said Guidelines (distressed restructuring on a 
      defaulted exposure is subject to a probation period of at least one year â€“ see also Q&A 4867), all 
      conditions from paragraph 71 of such Guidelines should be satisfied for the reclassification of a 
      defaulted exposure or obligor to a non-defaulted status.

      As no trigger of default should continue to apply during a 3-months minimum probation period in accordance 
      with point (a) of paragraph 71 of the Guidelines, no indication of unlikeliness to pay should be met in 
      accordance with Article 178(1)(a) CRR and no material amount should be past due in accordance with point 
      (b) of Article 178(1) CRR during this period.

      Furthermore, as part of the assessment required by point (d)  (d) of paragraph 71 of the Guidelines, 
      point (b) of that paragraph paragraph  required that the institution takes into account the behavior 
      of the obligor during this probation period before reclassifying a defaulted exposure to non-defaulted status, 
      and thus the institution should consider any  past due amount during this period in the analysis of the 
      behavior of the obligor.
